Description
Battle Simulator is a text-based game where the player (represented by the hero) engages in battles with randomly generated monsters.
Players can specify the number of monsters to battle, and each character has randomized health, attack strength, and defense stats. 
The battle continues in a turn-based system, where each character attacks the other based on their stats, and the game ends when the hero or all monsters are defeated.
